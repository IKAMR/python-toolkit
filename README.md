## Python snippets
- **CSV Spliter Tool**
   ```python
   The **CSV Splitter Tool** is a versatile Python script designed to split large CSV files into smaller, manageable parts. It supports splitting by:
	- File size (e.g., 500 bytes, 50kB, 200MB, 1GB).
	- Row count (e.g., maximum rows per file).
	- Specific column values (e.g., grouping by file extensions).
	- A combination of these criteria.

	This tool is useful for handling large datasets, organizing data by categories, or preparing files for downstream processing.
